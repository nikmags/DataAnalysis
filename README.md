# DataAnalysis

"""
The purpose of this project is to utilize Pandas (an open-source software library for the Python programming language, designed for data manipulation and analysis). I started by downloading a real up to date data set (RMS Crime Incidents from the City fo Detriot's open data portal) in a .csv format and manipulating the data into various subsets, graphs for analysis, and deployed other statistical analysis techniques. Having done this I was able to reach a concclusion and prvide insight and recomendtions for the city fo detriot.
